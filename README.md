## Raycasting Demo
The raycasting is very basic and there is no collision detection but this is only a proof of concept made to practice working with vectors.

### Features
- Raycasting in plain old JavaScript (no library needed).
- Minimap that shows the FOV and the raycast hits locations.
- Easy to edit map (it is a simple color matrix).

### How to run
Clone the repository and open __index.html__.
